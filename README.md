# School_District_Analysis

##Overview 
The purpose of the analysis is to take school and student performance data to create table data with outcomes for various categories, after replacing corrupted data with nulls.

##Results
After removing the corrupt data:
- The district summary did not significantly change
- The school summary also did not change significantly 
- Thomas High School remained second in overall percentage passing rank
- Math and reading scores for the ninth grade did not change significantly
- Scores by school spending did not change
- Scores by school size did not change 
- Scores by school type did not change

##Summary of Changes
After removing the reading and math scores for Thomas High School for the ninth grade, we no longer have data for that category. The district summary, school summary, and average ninth grade reading and math scores changed slightly, as seen in the screenshots.
